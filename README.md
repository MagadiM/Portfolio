# Portfolio Project

This project will include a website portfolio  that showcases my skills set, projects worked on and all relevant information. It will also reveal my journey as a student and an eventual software developer. The site will include infomation about me, my skills as  a Full Stack developer with expertise ranging from web development, to backend dev. 
I am leveraging my skills in JavaScript to produce an interactive site that showcases my abilities.
It will also redirect users to my blog spaces at Dev.to and hashnode plus github, platforms through which I tell of my journey is the dev world.
